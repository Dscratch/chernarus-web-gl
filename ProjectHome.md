Reading data from a height map and rendering the terrain in WebGl

Credit to both [Learning WebGL](http://www.learningwebgl.com) and by proxy [NeHe](http://nehe.gamedev.net/) for getting me started with WebGL, some of their code persists in the project.

Credit to [Bohemia Interactive](http://www.bistudio.com/) for the Chernarus map and [andrepcg](http://dayzmod.com/forum/index.php?/topic/34679-chernarus-height-map/) from the DayZMod forums for ripping the heightmap and kindly providing a copy to me.
